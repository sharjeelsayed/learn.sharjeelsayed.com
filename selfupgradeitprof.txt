            Tips:
                How to get X Ray in a side loaded book
                1) In calibre, go into "edit metadata" and add the amazon ID number. Important: make sure you're using the amazon ID number from the kindle store, not from another edition of the book
                2) Use the "Quality Check" plugin to "Fix ASIN for kindle fire"
                3) Convert to AZW3 (not .mobi)
                4) Repeat step 2. This is probably unnecessary but it just takes a second.
